# [Memory Card Game](https://youtu.be/FxDirbh3tXc)
In this project, I learned how to create a Java match card memory game using Pok√©mon Energy Cards with the built-in Java AWT/Swing graphics library.
, And how to randomly place cards onto the board, use a timer to create a delay before flipping the cards, create click handlers for selecting two cards and checking if they match, track and display error counts, and create a restart game button to shuffle and reorder the cards.
